# Smart Temperature and Gas Detection System Using Arduino UNO

## Overview

The Smart Temperature and Gas Detection System is an embedded safety monitoring project developed using the Arduino UNO microcontroller. The system continuously monitors the surrounding temperature and detects combustible gas leakage using a DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor and an MQ Gas Sensor.

Whenever the measured temperature exceeds **28°C** or the gas sensor value exceeds **400**, the Arduino activates an LED and buzzer while displaying an appropriate warning message on a 16×2 I2C LCD display.

The system provides four operating states:

- Safe Zone
- Temperature Warning
- Gas Warning
- Danger

This project is designed as a low-cost, reliable, and easy-to-implement safety monitoring solution suitable for homes, laboratories, and educational applications.

# System Output

## Safe Zone

Under normal environmental conditions, the LCD displays **SAFE ZONE** and both the LED and buzzer remain OFF.

## Temperature Warning

When the measured temperature exceeds **28°C**, the LCD displays **TEMP WARNING**, while the LED and buzzer are activated automatically.

---

## Gas Warning

When the MQ Gas Sensor detects combustible gas above the threshold value of **400**, the LCD displays **GAS WARNING**, and the LED and buzzer are activated.

---

## Danger Mode

When both the temperature and gas level exceed the predefined threshold values simultaneously, the LCD displays **DANGER**, and both the LED and buzzer remain ON.

# Working Principle

- Arduino UNO continuously reads temperature and humidity from the DHT11 sensor.
- The MQ Gas Sensor continuously measures combustible gas concentration.
- The Arduino compares both sensor readings with predefined threshold values.
- If the readings remain within the safe range, the LCD displays **SAFE ZONE**.
- If only the temperature exceeds **28°C**, the LCD displays **TEMP WARNING**.
- If only the gas value exceeds **400**, the LCD displays **GAS WARNING**.
- If both values exceed the threshold limits, the LCD displays **DANGER**.
- During unsafe conditions, both the LED and buzzer are activated immediately.
